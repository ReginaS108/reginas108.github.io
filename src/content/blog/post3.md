Devify was created as we wanted to simulate a fullstack developer working environment where we were tasked to design an E-commerce website. 
Applying the agile methodology, we divided the project into smaller phases, which allowed us to collaborate and continuously build on our plan.
We brainstormed many ideas and drew inspiration from many different companies. We ultimately decided to imitate (to the best of our ability), 
the <a href="https://petkit.com">Petkit.com</a> design, while selling Apple products. 

Our initial concept involved designing a <a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/minimum-viable-product/">Minimal Viable Product</a>, 
which would involve a simple home page with a list of our products for sale. As we progressed with our project, 
we implemented different features to improve interactivity for the user. We designed an Image Carousel, Navigational Bar, and a Sliding Cart feature
for our webpage with the ability to add items and checkout the cart using Stripe Payment.

Overall, this was an amazing learning experience that fuelled my interest in software development. I encountered many learning curves, such as the Nav bar and using styling frameworks.
I had many issues with formatting the Nav Bar and also applying animations for a smoother transition when opening/closing. We also used two styling frameworks (Tailwind & Bootstrap), which
may have caused the issue with animations. In the future, I would recommend to sticking with a single framework to prevent conflicts between using multiple frameworks.
