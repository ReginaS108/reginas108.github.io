This is a small front-end personal project to try learn and understand how <a href="https://blogs.mulesoft.com/learn-apis/api-led-connectivity/what-are-apis-how-do-apis-work/">API's work</a>. This program makes HTTP GET request to retrieve the data from <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">Pokeapi.co</a>. PokeAPI processes the request and sends back a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON">JSON-formatted</a> response on a specific pokemon and return it as a sprite image. As you can probably tell, I am still currently working on this project and will hopefully make more updates shortly!
